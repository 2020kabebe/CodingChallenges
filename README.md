## Challenges

### 1. Array Manipulation (`src/ArrayMap.java`)
- Problem: Find if a contiguous subarray sums up to a target value.
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
- Technique: Sliding Window

### 2. String Transformation (`src/StringTransform.java`)
- Problem: Transform a string based on its length divisibility by 3, 5, or 15.
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(n)
- Techniques: String manipulation, ASCII conversion
